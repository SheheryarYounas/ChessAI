# ChessAI
A chess game implementation powered by artificial intelligence using the Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm. This project aims to create a challenging chess-playing experience by leveraging the advanced decision-making capabilities of AI. The Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm optimizes the search process, allowing the AI player to evaluate potential moves efficiently and make informed decisions. This project is developed in Python.
