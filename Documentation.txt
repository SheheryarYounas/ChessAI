1. The constructor in Board.py initializes the board by first creating a horizontal row of 8 elements with "-" values. Then this is repeated for 8 times to create 8 rows.
2. The __str__ function gives a name to the object of that class. Useful for when I insert the object into the array index, it will directly provide a name.
3. I created the ChessBoard class. The constructor initializes the initial state of board without any pieces.
4. The initialSetup method then places the pieces of chess on the board to start the game.
5. The ChessPiece is a parent class which contains the color and string representation method. The child classes then inherit these methods along with the empty move methods which
will be given an implementation later.
6. These child classes are imported in ChessBoard and placed on the board in the initialSetup method.
7. Main function creates instance of ChessBoard (object) and calls the initialSetup method. It then prints the board. The board is now set up.
